Hello. 
Welcome to my bedroom. 
It's not my bedroom. 
It's whiteboard with words on in, 
but I'm going to teach you about bedroom vocabulary that is. 
Stay tuned. 
Maybe I'll teach you some other bedroom vocabulary if you know what I mean. 
We're going to go on the innocent side today, 
and I'm going to teach you about basic things in bedrooms. 
I know.
I know.
Okay.
This is a bed.
Do you sleep on bed, or do you sleep on "futon"?
Did I speak Japanese?
Hi, Japanese people in the house.
Konnichiwa.
O-genki desu ka?
When you sleep, you usually sleep on a "futon".
We have stolen your world.
We're so nice.
And we use it for our own.
"Futon" if you know or don't know is, basiclly a mattress that you put on the floor.
It sounds kind of uncomfortable, but it's really, 
really good if you're drunk, and there's never a fear or falling out of the bed.
You just kind of roll over and, boom, you're awake.
It has some advantages and some disadvantages.
So this is a picture of a bed. 
I am an artist. 
Remember this is as we go through this. 
The first very common thing that you will find in a dedroom is a pillow.
"Pillow". 
A lot of people I don't know why have never learned this word in English. 
I know it's not in a lot of textbooks. 
You don't open your textbook and go, "Wow, this is a pillow."
You're more like, "This is a pen."
Thanks.
I know that.
So the first one is a pillow. 
A "pillow" is a soft or hard, squishy thing that you put your head on 
not that head, this head. 
And to keep your pillow clean, you're going to put a pillow case on it.
